Introduction:-

    The problem of Video Synchronization has been studied extensively in the past. By "Video Synchronization", we refer to the problem of aligning, which may have different pace and may be recorded at different time, such that the resulting videos appear to move through the similar objects together. Traditionally, most of the existing solutions used spatial alignments between individual frames of the two videos to achieve synchronization. However, this wouldn't give accurate results if the videos were not in temporal alignment. Hence, our method takes into consideration both spatial and temporal cues for synchronizing the two videos.

    It has a lot of applications in Movie Productions and Visual effects, Video mosaicking, and stitching and action recognition. In movies having twin or duplicate roles, the actor is made to shoot two different sequences for the two characters. Then, the two videos are synchronized and then superimposed so that the resulting video consists of both the characters in the same frame.

    We extract the frames of the two videos and generate a cost matrix which gives the cost of aligning any two frames of the two videos. Both the spatial and temporal aspects are taken into consideration when generating the cost matrix. Lesser the cost, the better the alignment between those two frames. Hence, we compute shortest path in the Cost matrix. To do this, we use a modified version of Dijsktra's algorithm that gives the path having the lowest cost, and hence the best alignment between the two videos. We then smoothen this curve using Bezier's algorithm.

Result:-

    We applied our algorithm and the existing solution on a series of videos and obtained the following results.

    1) For High Definition (HD) Videos, our algorithm was found to be on par with the existing solutions.
    2) For Low Quality or Noisy Videos, such as the ones shot by Smartphone cameras, we found that our algorithm gives considerably better synchronization between the two. 

    (For pictures)
    a. Frame 1 of the original video.
    b. Frame 61 of the original video.
    c. Frame 121 of the original video.
    d. Frame 181 of the original video.
